                "This is my 2 semster project, that was making made in collaboration with the Fantasy festival with the focus on the quest part of the festival. They wanted a website that shows that they have a day quest, which is for more family oriented and an evening quest which is more grown-up oriented. they also wanted a way for the quest goers to know that they were on the right path. As such we made a folder and a map made out of wood where they would get a new piece of the map after the quest, scorers solved puzzles. if we were also asked to make a trailer for the festival quest such I used the characters from the quest which they provided and made an animated trailer that to that taunts the viewer into doing the quest",
